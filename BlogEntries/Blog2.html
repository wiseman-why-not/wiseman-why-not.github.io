      <h4>What is the difference</h4>
      <p>A switch is a multi-way branch statement. It provides an easy
      way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.</p>
      <p>A else if is a decision making statement. It is used to decide whether a certain statement or
      block of statements will be execuetd or not.</p>
      <p>You can usually get what you need done using both, but deciding whether
        to use if or else if statements, or a switch statement is based on readability
        and the expression that the statement is testing. A switch statement is
        usuallymore efficient that a set of nested if statements.
      </p>
      <h4>Why use one over the other</h4>
      <p>An else if statemetn can test expressions based on ranges of values or conditions,
      a switch statements test expressions based on simgle integers, enumerated values, or string object.
      </p>
      <p>Switch is better for multi way branching. When a compiler complies a switch statements,
         it will inspect each of the case constant and create a jump table that
         it will use for selecting the path of execution depending on the value
         of the equivalent logic coded using a sequece of if-else. The compliler
         can do this because it knows that the case constants are all the same type
         and simply must be compared for equality with the switch expression,
         while the if expressions, the complier has no such knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>else if better conditional branches are great for variable conditions that results in a boolean,
      whereas switch stements are great for fixed data values.</p>
      <p>Switch statements might be faster. If the number of cases are more than 5,
        otherwise, you may use an else if too.
      </p>
      <p>Readability, a switch looks cleaner when you have to combine cases.
         adding/removing labels is also easier with a switch and makes your code
         easier to change and maintain.
       </p>
       <p>Implement whichever design is clearer and mor maintainable as per the demand of your code.</p>
