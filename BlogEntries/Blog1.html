      <h4>What is Math.random()</h4>
      <p>Math.random() is a class that generates a random double value between (0.0 - 1.0).</p>
      <p>Well let's first break it down Math. The word "Math" is a class name.
        A class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created.
        Think of it as the object being a finish product a something. It could
        be a real world object like a computer,a desk, a cat, a human, a phone.
        The class is a blueprint or template which we use to create the object.
        We use different classes to build the object. For an example if a human
        was our object, we might have a class for the head, because all humans
        have heads. The "random()" is a method. A method is a collection of
        statments peforming an operation or several of them. Methods tend to do
        something. For classes we use convention and start with a captial.
        Math is the class, next we use a "." to connect the class and the method.
        "." let go in the class and select a specific method. random() is the method,
        the action we want to preform.
      </p>
      <h4>Why use Math.random()</h4>
      <p>Because your trying to obtain a random number, that you don't want to
         know the exact number to. It is a great way to run simulations. Keep
         in mind that you get a range from 0 to 1; 0 is included but not 1.
      </p>
      <h4>How to use Math.random()</h4>
      <p>(int)(Math.random() * 10) -- returns a random integer between 0 - 9.</p>
      <p>50 + (int) (Math.random() * 50) -- returns a random integer between 50 - 99</p>
