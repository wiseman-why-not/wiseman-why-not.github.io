      <h4>What is "cast a double to an int"</h4>
      <p>Cast a double to an int can better be said as convert a double to and integer.</p>
      <p>What is casting? Casting is taking an Object of specific type and making
        it into another Object type. Converting a numberic value from one type to another type.
      </p>
      <p>Casing is a process of converting one type to another, but in Java,
         types from teh same type hierarchy can be cast or converted into each other.
         If you try to cast two objects which don't share the same type hierarchy,
         i.e there is no parent-child relationshiop between them. You will get a
         complie time error.
      </p>
      <h4>Why cast a double to an int</h4>
      <p>You could be dealing with a method that returns a double, but you might
        not want the numbers after the decimal or need to change it to an int so
        you can use it with another method that uses int values. Casting a double
        to and int will remove the numbers after the decimal, it will not round up.
      </p>
      <h4>What does it look like</h4>
      <p>double myDoubleNumber = 45.12;</p>
      <p>int myIntNumber = (int)myDoubleNumber;</p>
      <p>myIntNumber = 45</p>
      <br>
      <p>Double myDoubleNumber = 45.12;</p>
      <p>int myIntNumber = Integer.valueOf(myDoubleNumber.intValue() );</p>
      <p>myIntNumber = 45</p>
      <h4>How is this happening?</h4>
      <p>
        double and int are primitive data types that start with a lowercase character.
        Double and Integers are numeric classes, which makes it possible to use them
        like objects and using methods on method like inValue() or valueOf().
