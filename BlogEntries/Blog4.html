      <h4>What is java.util.Scanner ?</h4>
      <p>The java.util.Scanner is a way to get a users input.</p>
      <p>Lets break down java.util.Scanner. java.util is a package, and Scanner
        is a class in that package to get input. You need to import this package
        into your application if you want to use this class. It's not automatically
        imported because not all applications need to get input in.
      </p>
      <h4>java packages? </h4>
      <p>java.util is a package tht is a pre-written library of packages and classes.
        instead of coding these methods, they are free to use which should make your job
        of building something easier. The java in "java.util" come from the Java platform, standard edition.
        The util in "java.util" is just the name of the package.

      <h4>How to use java.util.Scanner;</h4>
      <p>You first want to type "import java.util.Scanner;" at the top of your text editor, before your class is created.
        After your main method, call the Scanner class, then your scanner variable name.
        this will equal to a new class of Scanner with the parameter of (System.in)
        which means it is going to read from the standard input stream of the program.
        It looks a little lie this:
      </p>
      <p>import java.util.Scanner;</p>
      <p>public class SomeRandomClass{</p>
        <p>public static void main(String[] args) {</p>
          <p>Scanner myVaribleName = new Scanner(System.in);</p>
          <p>/* </p>
          <p>   random code</p>
          <p>*/</p>
          <p>}</p>
          <p>}</p>
